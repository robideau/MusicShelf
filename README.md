# MusicShelf 

MusicShelf (name obviously pending) is a Unity-based music library and visualization software developed with the Oculus Rift and other VR hardware in mind. Consider the project split into two major halves - the first half being the "library" portion which reads, indexes, and stores all of the user's desired mp3 (other formats too hopefully) files and presents them in a "bookshelf" fashion. This shelf will allow the user to search through their music and access it in a visually pleasing format with intuitive VR-focused controls. Ideally the only interactions will be through the camera direction and a very limited set of controller/keyboard keys.

The second half of the project consists of a randomly-seeded visualization software. Think Windows Media Player visuals but on a larger, more varied scale. The visuals will eventually tailor themselves to the songs or albums chosen by the user. Visualizations will be consistent across different systems; each song will have unique visuals but will be replicable on other machines provided the same source files are used.

### Who is responsible for this nonsense?

MusicShelf is currently in development by [David Robideau](https://github.com/robideau) and [John Kirchner](https://github.com/Jjjohn). If you help out, we'd be glad to throw your name up here too.
